 # **Sketchy App Blocker**

Sketchy App Blocker is a Python app that utilizes the Windows Command Prompt to block applications and override DNS lookup, blocking sites as well. Sketchy follows a schedule set by the user, blocking apps during certain times of the day and week.

Sketchy was one of my first Python projects. I learnt Python as I developed this project, hence the spaghetti code, lack of proper comments and inconsistent variable naming. Sketchy is a functional based programming project, which is hindsight was a bad idea. 

You can find a demonstration of the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tTuM99Hxrs). 

## **Usage**

To run this project, download this repo on a windows computer and run the 'sketchy_app setup.py' file. Admin permission is required for the setup. Once the  setup file is executed, you can open 'Sketchy App Blocker.exe' to configure settings. **I do not recommend installing sketchy, as you have to manually uninstall the program.**
